#Create a population model to investigate evolution of drug resistance in tumors

#Imagine a cancer cell in a tumor that spontaneously exhibited a mutation that confers drug resistance
#The mutation does not have any positive or negative effects on growth rate of that sub-population when the cancer drug is absent
#However, when the cancer drug is present the mutant sub-population grows at 50% of its growth rate in the absence of the drug 
#and the non-mutant sub-population declines rapidly


#setting original r value for growth rate of normal and mutant cells
Rorig = .1
#carrying capacity
K = 1000000
#growth rate of normal cells when drug has been administered
Rdrug = -.1

#number of timesteps in timeline
timesteps = 500

#creating empty vectors of the length of the number of timesteps

#Mutant cell was supposed to appear early so began with one mutant cell
#mutant cell appears when 100 normal cells are present

#current normal and mutant population levels
for(t in 1:(timesteps-1)){
  #when total cell count is above 960000 (very close to carrying capacity), drug is administered
  if((Ncount[t] + Mcount[t]) > 996000 & druglevel == FALSE){
    
    druglevel = TRUE
  }
  #add in mutant cell when normal cell count is within 5 of 100
  if(Ncount[t]>95 & Ncount[t]<105 & onlyonce == TRUE){
